## Criterias

### 1 - Creativity

The simplicity of the app didn't really require any advanced concept. The layout I've made is rather simple;

### 2 - Quality

I have not added any test because of time restraint. I would use Jasmine and Angular itself for testing, even thought end-to-end tests could be added. For that, I would suggest WebDriver.IO.

### 3 - Programming Structure

The project is so simple that I haven't felt the need to add design patterns. I've tried to achieve a good organization within Angular modules and doesn't over-engineer. In this case, I've done a simple code separation for clarity purposes
